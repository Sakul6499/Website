# University Project 3: Traffic Control System

The goal of this project is to develop a simulated traffic control system.
It should feature different street types, crossing, and everything else that is involved with traffic control!
However, the project was not only about cars but also included pedestrians, bicycles and other types of vehicles (such as ambulances).

In the end, the traffic control system should work autonomous and optimize traffic using artificial intelligence.
The simulation should also support adding and removing simulated objects (such as cars, streets, crossings, traffic lights, etc.).

We utilized [Java] and [JavaFX] for this project.
Everything was locally simulated, so no backend, database or server was required.
This project emphasized on utilizing design patterns smartly and effectively, as well as defending the choice against others.
