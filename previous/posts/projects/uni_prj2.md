# University Project 2: Business application for Liquid Transport Company

This project was about modernizing a paper-based company that specialized in transporting liquids.
First, we had to analyze the current working process of this company.
Afterwards, we then had to design and implement an application that is familiar to all employees, but also modern, connected and no longer paper-based.

The frontend was build using Java and JavaFX.
We then connected the application to a backend via a REST-API.
For the backend, we utilized Spring.io and also connected a PostgreSQL database to it.
Furthermore, we split the whole application into multiple parts and made the distribution of all systems easier with Docker.

Additionally, the project followed an Agile-Scrum workflow, supported by Trello and Confluence.
We used JUnit for Test-Driven-Development and Subversion as a Version-Control-System.
