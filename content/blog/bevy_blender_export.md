## Context

[Bevy] (or [Bevy-Engine]) is
> "A refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in [Rust] Free and Open Source Forever!"
>
> -- [Bevy]

Many people turn to [Blender], a Free and Open-Source 3D-Suite, when creating assets for their [Bevy] game.  
And there is the problem: Blender uses it's own file format `.blend`, while also being able to export into many different formats like `.obj`, `.fbx`, `.gltf` and many more.  
_[Blender] can also render images and whole movies._

The question now becomes:  
> What is the best format to use when exporting from [Blender] to be used with [Bevy], and how is this done the best way?

Before we head into any details I want to make my intentions clear:

First of all, I had trouble finding any up-to-date resource on this.
There are a few blog posts explaining (very) roughly how to do this, but none is up-to-date as of writing this and all came with a lot of problems.
This blog-post is intended to be an up-to-date resource for others.

Secondly, this guide is written for [Blender] version 3.4 and [Bevy] 0.9.  
Both, [Blender] and [Bevy], are still working on glTF support.  
Thus, things may change in the future.

Thirdly, my goal was also to automate this process using [Python] scripts.  
Said scripts will be included here and can be freely used if credited.

Lastly, this guide expects some very basic skills in [Blender], [Bevy] and [Rust].
The python scripts can be used without any [Python] knowledge.

## Why glTF

[Blender] and [Bevy] both support many different formats.
Choosing the right one can be a challenging task.

The main problem with most formats is that they are proprietary.
Usually meaning: hard to license and official parsers and writers are either closed source or don't exist at all.
This often leads to partial implementations of said parsers/writers which may or may not work and different applications may use different parsers/writers making them incompatible with each other.

[glTF] is different in those regards.  
> glTFâ„¢ is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by engines and applications. glTF minimizes the size of 3D assets, and the runtime processing needed to unpack and use them. glTF defines an extensible, publishing format that streamlines authoring workflows and interactive services by enabling the interoperable use of 3D content across the industry.
>
> -- [Khronos Group glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)

This is ideal for us!
Not only area there official libraries, but the whole standard is defined in a [specification document](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/) readable by everyone.
This enables glTF to be used universally.

[glTF] also supports three versions of it's format:

- `.gltf`: A JSON-like format that describes everything in a human-readable fashion. Slower to process and read but easier to debug and change things quick (if you aren't exporting them).
- `.glb`: A binary format that is optimized for loading and streaming inside engines.
- `.gltf + .bin`: A mixture of both where the main values (like settings, locations, etc.) are stored in a JSON-like format (`.gltf`) and things like models, meshes, textures, meshes are compressed into a binary (`.bin`). However, loosing either of the files invalidates the whole file.

Additionally, [glTF] supports a wide range of things you can pack into it.  
Primarily, we are interested in:

- Models
- Meshes
- Textures
- Materials
- Scenes

And luckily [glTF] can do all of this!
... with some caveats as we will find out.

However, there is also a downside:  
[glTF] is relatively new (as of writing this) format.
While [Blender] and [Bevy] both implement it, there are features missing on both ends.
However, there are also lots of workarounds for those missing features.
[glTF] is currently very well priced as _THE next format_ in anything that uses graphical engines and is very likely to be fully implemented within no time at all.

## Exporting

This guide will cover two ways of exporting [glTF] from [Blender] to be used by [Bevy]:

- Manual Exporting
- Automated Exporting

Both ways require the same setup, but we will start with manual exporting to show the full workflow.
Let's start there.

### Project Setup

First, let's create a new Blender Project and add some model.
You can delete or keep the default cube, camera and light, or delete them.
important point is to have a or multiple model in your project like so:

![Blender example project](/bevy_blender_export/blender_example_project.png)

### Manual Exporting

With this setup, we can click on `File > Export > glTF` in the top left corner:

![Blender export menu](/bevy_blender_export/blender_export_menu.png)

In the new menu we can select a location for the [glTF] to be saved, but before clicking on export look to the right side!
These settings are **essential** for [Bevy] to properly import this model.

First of all, you can choose the format there like mentioned above:

![glTF format menu](/bevy_blender_export/gltf_format_menu.png)

This format is for you to choose, [Bevy] will work with any of the three.

Next, make sure to have these settings:

![glTF format menu](/bevy_blender_export/gltf_settings.png)

> Tip: If you select "Remember Export Settings" at the top under Copyright Blender will remember these settings in this `.blend` file.
> Making exporting much faster in the future.

Here is a short overview:

`Include > Limit to` defines what gets into the [glTF] file.  
It doesn't matter what you chose here, but generally `Visible Objects` is a good choice.
You can hide whatever you don't want in your [glTF].  

`Include > Data` defines what data is included.
Check `Custom Properties`, this includes extra data and makes it easier work with glTF inside [Blender] later.
You can export Lights and Cameras from Blender but you loose control over them inside [Bevy].  
Furthermore, specific files like a scene or player may include those, but **don't pack cameras and lights into every mesh export you do**.

`Transform > +Y Up` should be checked.  
This is the orientation Bevy uses.

`Data > Mesh` defines how our _Mesh_ is exported.  
Check whatever you need.
However, it may be a good idea to export "everything but Loose*" by default to ensure the model is in [Bevy] as close as possible to [Blender].

`Data > Material` defines how our _Materials_ are exported.
Set `Materials` to `Export` and `Images` to `Automatic`.
This will export **all** used Materials by default and convert them if needed.

> Note that [Blender] currently only exports in PNG and if it's another format they will be converted to either PNG or JPEG.
> Something like KTX2 or DDS are much better for graphical engines but are nto yet supported by [Blender].
> [Bevy] needs a special feature flag for those.

`Data > PBR Extensions` defines how PBR Materials are exported.  
I couldn't find a difference between the options.
Exporting with the [Blender] default will _probably_ get you the closest to how it looks in [Blender].

`Data > Lighting` defines how lighting is exported.
`Standard` light works very well with [Bevy].

`Data > Compression` defines if the [glTF] is compressed (if the format `.glb` or `.gltf + .bin` is selected).  
**[Bevy] does not support this compression at the moment.**
**Thus, turn this off!**

`Animation` defines how _Animations_ are exported.
Let them at default settings, this guide is not about Animation exports.

With this we can hit the `Export glTF` button and save the file.

### Bevy Usage

Inside your [Bevy] project we need to define a new _System_:

```rust
fn scene_renderer(
    mut commands: Commands,
    assets: Res<AssetServer>,
) {
    // ...
}
```

Now all we need to do to load out [glTF] file is:

1. Load it with the `AssetServer`
2. Tell `Commands` to spawn a `SceneBundle`

```rust
commands.spawn(SceneBundle {
    scene: assets.load("assets/scene.gltf#Scene0"),
    ..default()
});
```

> In this case I exported the [glTF] file into `assets/scene.gltf`.
> Your file may be with a `.glb` extension if you choose the binary format and may be in a different path.
> Adjust accordingly.

Now there is one weird bit here: The `#Scene0` at the end.  
As we established, [glTF] supports a wide range of use cases.
The hashtag (`#`) tells the `AssetServer` to not load the whole file, but a specific section of that file.
In our case we load `Scene0` which is always the first and default scene of this file.
There could be multiple scenes in our [glTF] and we could access them with `Scene1`, `Scene2`, ..., `SceneX`.  
**It's important to know that if you don't add the `#Scene0` (or similar) to the file-path, [Bevy] will load the _whole_ file and will require you to do some more manual work on what needs to be spawned where.**

> Furthermore, we could load _just_ the _Mesh_ with `#Mesh0`.  
> Export to `.gltf` (JSON-like format) and open it in your code editor if you are curious about what there is.

Now all we need to do is call this _System_ like so:

```rust
app.add_startup_system(Self::scene_render); 
```

Below you will find the full example.
However, your implementation may vary wildly of this.
I'd also recommend putting this into a plugin and calling it based on an `AppState`.

```rust
fn scene_renderer(
    mut commands: Commands,
    assets: Res<AssetServer>,
) {
    commands.spawn(SceneBundle {
        scene: assets.load("assets/scene.gltf#Scene0"),
        ..default()
    });
}

// Somewhere in our plugin init _or_ main
app.add_startup_system(Self::scene_render); 
```

That's it.
You should see your model appear inside [Bevy].

If you can't see it take a look into [Bevy]'s log and check if the path and export is correct.  
You can also open a new Blender project and `File > Import > glTF` to validate what was exported!

### Adding materials

Now... this seemed to simple, didn't it?

If you now add a simple _Material_ to your _Model_ in [Blender] everything will work fine.  
But just one colour is kinda boring, isn't it?

Try using the _Shading Nodes_ in [Blender] for your Material.  
Inside [Blender] it will look fine, no matter what you do.
Try exporting it as a [glTF] and then reimport into [Blender].  
Still, everything looks fine (assuming you applied the export settings correctly).  

But now try importing the [glTF] into [Bevy].  
There are _some_ (very little) things that will work inside [Bevy].
You may be lucky and it just works, but that's a rare case.
Most likely you will get a `StandardMaterial` inside Bevy that has a light-yellow standard colour.
That's no good.

The problem is that [Blender] has it's shading nodes and _some_ (but rarely if at all) translate to [glTF] shading, while [Bevy] has it's own _Material_ and _Shading_ system. Again, some of [glTF] features include _Materials_ and _Shading_ but neither does [Blender] export it "correctly" at the moment, nor does [Bevy] import it "correctly".  
In the future [Blender] and [Bevy] may play nicely with [glTF] _Materials_.

Now how do we fix this?  
The solution sounds complicated at first but is actually a very easy process!  
Here is what we need to do:

1. Create a uniform object to apply our _Material_ on (e.g. `Plane`).
2. Apply our _Material_ on this object.
3. Inside the _Material_ create a `Texture Node` (no need to attach it).
4. Create a new _Texture_ from the `Texture Node`.
5. **Change [Blender] to _Cycles_ (`Render Properties > Render Engine`)**.
6. Under `Render Properties > Bake` make some changes and hit the `Bake` button.
7. Ensure [Blender] bundles _Textures_ (`File > External Data > Automatically Pack Resources`) (or: Save the _Texture_ externally).
8. Go back to our original object and add a new _Material_.
9. Open the new _Material_ in the _Shading Nodes_.
10. Import the created _Texture_ and use it as our Color.

> Note that this only covers the "Diffuse" Map (i.e. color), but you can repeat those steps for e.g. Normals, Roughness, etc.

How does this work? How does this change things?  
Simple! The "baking" creates a _Texture_ for us.
This _Texture_ is then imported and used as our _Material_.
[glTF] supports _Textures_ and so does [Bevy]!
When importing into [Bevy], the _Texture_ will be unpacked from the [glTF] and applied.
No custom [Blender] nodes involved!

The downside of this is that we now have a two-step process:

1. `Bake` the _Texture_.  
2. Export to [glTF].

However, if there hasn't been changes to the _Material_ there is no need to `Bake`!  
Assuming [Blender] packed the _Texture_ correctly first time.

Now let's see how this is done:

First, we need to create a uniform object in [Blender].  
For our use-case a _Plane_ works the best, but other use-cases may use any other shapes.

> Make sure to disable Viewing and Rendering of the original _Object_!

![Add plane in Blender](/bevy_blender_export/blender_plane.png)

Next, we apply the _Material_ (or create a new one) to the _Object_:

![Blender Material](/bevy_blender_export/blender_material.png)

Now, we a _Image Texture_ Node and create a new Image:

![Blender Add Image-Texture](/bevy_blender_export/blender_add_image_texture.png)

> You should change the Name and Resolution of this Texture.  
> 1024 x 1024 = 1k Textures  
> 4096 x 4096 = 4k Textures  
> etc.

Change into Cycles if not already done:

![Blender change to Cycles](/bevy_blender_export/blender_change_to_cycles.png)

> If you can it's recommended to set Cycles to use your GPU.
> This will reduce rendering times by a lot.

Scroll down to find the `Bake` settings and apply the following:

![Blender Bake Settings](/bevy_blender_export/blender_bake_settings.png)

> In our case we **just** want the color values, no shading, light, whatsoever.
> You may change this based on what your _Texture_ needs.

Pay attention to the `Bake Type` too!

![Blender Bake Type](/bevy_blender_export/blender_bake_type.png)

By default this will be `Combined`.  
Like the name suggest, this combines all (most?) of the `Bake Types` into one image.

This may be useful if you want to extract multiple _Texture Maps_ from one _Texture_ later.
But for our use-case we _just_ want the Colors.
This is called the _Diffuse Map/Texture_.

Alternatively, instead of using the `Combined` `Bake Type`, we can repeat the same process multiple times for each `Bake Type` we need.

Now hit the `Bake` button atop and wait!  
At the bottom there will be a progress bar, depending on your hardware and _Texture_ resolution this may take a bit.

Once done, you can view the _Texture_ in the _Image View_:

![Result: Brick Texture](/bevy_blender_export/BrickTexture.png)

Double check that everything is looking as it should.

Now, we go back to our original _Object_ and create a new "Fake" _Material_:

![Blender add new Fake Material](/bevy_blender_export/blender_add_new_material.png)

> Make sure to disable viewing and rendering of the Plane and re-enable it for the _Object_!

Lastly, open this "Fake" _Material_ as _Shading Nodes_, add the `Image Texture` Node and select (from the list, not "Open"!) the generated _Texture_.
(Or, if you saved your _Texture_ externally, click on "Open" and import it!)  
Then hookup the Color like so:

![Blender add Texture to Fake Material](/bevy_blender_export/blender_add_texture_to_fake_material.png)

> If you have multiple textures, e.g. for Normals, repeat this step with the other textures and/or extract it from the `Combined` _Texture_.

If everything was done right the _Texture_ should appear on the _Object_.

Now, optionally, based on your _Object_, you may still need to adjust UV Maps:

![Blender UV Map](/bevy_blender_export/blender_uv.png)

If you now export from [Blender] to [glTF] like above and import the [glTF] into [Bevy], everything should be working perfectly fine.

### Advice for Blender Project organization

Now that everything is exporting as it should, let me give some advice:

_Textures/Materials_ are commonly used multiple times per different _Objects_.
With this current setup the _Material_, Plane Setup, etc. would have to be repeated **for each _Object_ Blender Project**.
This will make organizing much more complicated, Baking must be done in different steps and re-using _Textures/Materials_ is complicated if not impossible.

To solve this and make it **much** easier to keep organized we can use the fact that [glTF] can be universally used for _Models/Meshes_, _Materials/Textures_ and _Scenes_.
And that's exactly what I am suggesting!

Create (for this project) three Blender Projects:

- One for the _Material/Texture_, includes the Baking process and packs the Texture inside the `.blend`.
- One for the _Model/Mesh_ itself, will link against the Baked _Texture_ from the first file.
- One for the _Scene_, where all the _Models/Meshes_ are organized and put together into a _Scene_ that can be imported into [Bevy].

The beauty of this approach is that for as long as the linked `.blend` files are in tact and the paths didn't change (which can be relative!), we only need to export from the _Scene_ Blender Project.  
This export will automatically fetch everything needed from the linked files.
This includes _Materials/Textures_, _Models/Meshes_ and everything that is required to successfully export.

The only downside of this is that we are now working with three files.  
For each _Material_ we would add a new Project File.  
For each _Model_ we would add a new Project File.  
And we can't edit linked Files from the _Scene_, but have to open the e.g. _Material_ file itself.  

We also need to make sure that changes are detected upstream.
Meaning since we have this dependency order: `Scene -> Mesh -> Material`.
And we change the `Material` (and bake it!), we need to make sure that our `Mesh` **and** the `Scene` gets updated with this change.  
This _should_ work out of the box with [Blender], but just to be sure I may suggest keeping the total linked File-Count low.

### Automated Exporting

Finally we reached the automation part.
[Blender] does this quite easily actually.  
[Blender] gives us a fully features Python API.
Everything you can do in the [Blender] UI, you can do with the Python API.  
Just... possibly a bit more complicated.

I have written two scripts, partially sourced from StackOverflow, that solve two issues:

Firstly, `Bake` _Materials_ into _Textures_.
This _may_ only work if you are following the above suggestion of splitting the project into multiple Blender Files.
For as long as there is just one _Object_ and one _Material_, it should work flawlessly with any file.
Even with multiple _Texture_ outputs.  
The _Texture_ result will be **packed into the `.blend` file**.

Secondly, export a _Mesh/Model_ (or _Scene_!) from [Blender] to [glTF].
The script will automatically apply all the settings and even save them for future manual exports.  
The exact output location can be chosen via an argument.

#### Bake Script

Save the file below and use it like so:

```shell
blender your_blender_file.blend --background --python bake_all.py
```

This will automatically `Bake` and pack for us.

```python
# Loosely based on:
# - (baking) https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/10861
# - (saving) https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/143043

import os
import sys
import bpy

BLEND_FILE_ARG = sys.argv[1]
BLEND_FILE = os.path.abspath(BLEND_FILE_ARG)

print("Processing '" + BLEND_FILE_ARG + "' (" + BLEND_FILE + ") and packing afterwards ...");

scene = bpy.context.scene
print("Scene: " + scene.name)

# Clear selection
for object in scene.objects:
    object.select_set(False)

# Bake
for object in scene.objects:
    print("Object: " + object.name)

    # Make the object active
    bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = object
    object.select_set(True)

    # https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.object.html#bpy.ops.object.bake
    bpy.ops.object.bake(
        type = 'UV', 
        use_clear = True,
        # https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy_types_enum_items/bake_pass_type_items.html#rna-enum-bake-pass-type-items
        save_mode = 'INTERNAL',
    )

    # Unselect after
    object.select_set(False)

# Pack it!
bpy.ops.file.pack_all() #Pack all images into the file

# Save it!
bpy.ops.wm.save_as_mainfile(filepath=bpy.data.filepath)
```

#### glTF Export Script

Save the file below and use it like so:

```shell
blender your_blender_file.blend --background --python gltf_export.py -- your_gltf_output.gltf
```

This will automatically export your Blender file to [glTF].

To change the export format change the `export_format='GLTF_EMBEDDED'` below to `'GLB'` (binary format), `'GLTF_EMBEDDED'` (JSON-like format) and `'GLTF_SEPARATE'` (JSON-like + binary packed format).

```python
import bpy
import sys
import os

OUTPUT_FILE=sys.argv[-1]
OUTPUT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(OUTPUT_FILE))

print("Blender export scene in glTF Format to file '" + OUTPUT_FILE + "' in directory: '" + OUTPUT_DIR + "'.")

# https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.export_scene.html#bpy.ops.export_scene.gltf
bpy.ops.export_scene.gltf(
    # Output File
    filepath=OUTPUT_FILE,
    # Don't warn if existing and overwrite
    check_existing=False, 
    # glTF Light
    convert_lighting_mode='SPEC', 
    # glTF Format
    export_format='GLTF_EMBEDDED', 
    # Copyright
    export_copyright='Bevy-Game', 
    # Image format
    export_image_format='AUTO', 
    # Texture output directory
    export_texture_dir=OUTPUT_DIR, 
    # What to export
    ## Careful with PBR textures!
    export_keep_originals=False, 
    export_texcoords=True, 
    export_normals=True, 
    export_tangents=True, 
    export_materials='EXPORT', 
    export_original_specular=False, 
    export_colors=True, 
    export_attributes=True, 
    use_mesh_edges=True, 
    use_mesh_vertices=True, 
    # No compression (Bevy doesn't support)
    export_draco_mesh_compression_enable=False, 
    # Selection of what is exported (everything "visible")
    use_visible=True, 
    use_selection=False, 
    use_renderable=False, 
    use_active_collection_with_nested=False, 
    use_active_collection=False, 
    use_active_scene=False, 
    # Camera will be added by Bevy
    export_cameras=False, 
    # Lights will be added by Bevy
    export_lights=False, 
    # Anything special (might break things!)
    export_extras=True, 
    # Axis for export (Y+ Up)
    export_yup=True, 
    # Apply modifiers
    export_apply=False, 
    # Remember export settings, nice for debugging!
    will_save_settings=True, 
)
```

## Afterwords

I hope this will help anyone.
I'd wish I would have found such a resource and wouldn't have figured all of this out myself.
